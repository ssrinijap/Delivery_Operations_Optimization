This study tackles the challenge faced by STEM Store, an e-commerce company specializing in educational toys and tools for STEM education, which has recently expanded into new cities. The rapid expansion led to a surge in order volumes and subsequent issues with delayed deliveries, resulting in customer dissatisfaction and loss to competitors. The primary goal is to enhance delivery efficiency, improve the Customer Delivery Satisfaction Index (CDSI), and reduce delivery costs across the newly expanded cities.

## Business Problem
STEM Store's expansion has led to logistical challenges manifesting as delayed deliveries, directly impacting customer satisfaction and competitiveness. The business problem centers on optimizing delivery operations to handle increased order volumes without compromising service quality. The core issues to address are:
* High delivery delays in specific cities leading to low CDSI scores.
* Inefficient allocation of delivery partners contributing to increased operational costs.

## Methodology
The approach to solving these challenges involves multiple steps utilizing data-driven insights:
* Calculation of Delivery Delays: Identifying cities with significant delivery delays by calculating the difference between the promised and actual delivery dates.
* Targeting Cities with Lowest CDSI: Prioritizing cities that require immediate intervention based on CDSI and delivery delays.
* Evaluating Alternative Delivery Agents: Using vendor rate cards to assess and compare potential delivery agents based on delivery time and cost.
* Re-mapping Vendors: Optimizing vendor allocation based on their performance rankings to improve lead times and reduce costs.
* Monitoring and Adjustment: Continuously monitoring the performance of the revised strategies and making necessary adjustments.

## Results and Conclusion
The implemented strategies led to significant improvements in delivery operations:
* Reduced Delivery Lead Times: The average delivery lead time was reduced by an average of  2-2.5 days (40% reduction) per shipment.
* Cost Reduction: Average cost per shipment decreased by $1-$1.5 (15% reduction), leading to substantial cost savings for the STEM Store.
* Improved CDSI: The strategic reallocation of delivery partners and optimization of vendor profiles significantly enhanced the Customer Delivery Satisfaction Index across targeted cities.
  
These results demonstrate the effectiveness of data-driven strategies in optimizing logistics and delivery operations, ultimately supporting STEM Storeâ€™s business growth and customer satisfaction. Future recommendations include enhancing customer service through dynamic profiling and vendor allocation before entering new markets to ensure operational cost-efficiency and effective contract negotiations.
